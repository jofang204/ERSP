      <h2>What is brain metastasis?</h2>
      <p>Brain metastasis occurs when cancer cells have spread from their primary site to the brain.</p>
      <h2>What is the current state of research?</h2>
      <p>There has not been much progress in the field of brain metastasis. There is currently no database avilable solely for
      brain metastasis research. Microarray databases such as ONCOMINE only contain datasets for all kinds of cancers.
      </p>
      <h2>Our motivation: </h2>
      <p>Brain metastasis is deadly. It has an incidence rate anywhere from 9%-17%, and could be higher. Once diagnosed,
      the median survival time in patients is only 2.3 months. Scientists have been unable to diagnose brain metastasis until it is already too late.</p>
      <h2>Our solution:</h2>
      <p>We have created this database in hopes that by compiling all available brain metastasis data in one
      conlidated platform can make analysis much more streamlined and efficient. Our hope is that with enough
      research, we can identify biomarkers that will allow us to diagnose brain metastasis while treatment or even prevention
      is still possible.</p>
      <h2> Our process:</h2>
      <p> To form the database, we first had to collect as much pubicly available data that we could. After collecting 2,000+ samples,
        we then annotated each dataset with defining features from each one. For example, a cancer sample can either be primary or metastatic, or
        or it can originate from the lungs or from the colon. We then produced 6 text files that contain different parts of this information, and
        these text files form our database</p>
